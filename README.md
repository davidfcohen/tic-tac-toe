# Tic-tac-toe
This project implements a tic-tac-toe AI written in C using the minimax algorithm.

**Usage:**
```
tictactoe [-s] [-p] [-d depth] [-v]
	-s: Simulate a full game of tic-tac-toe.
	-p: Use alpha-beta pruning.
	-d: Set the maximum depth of the decision tree (0-7).
	-v: Output the number of expanded nodes.
```
